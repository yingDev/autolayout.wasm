Welcome to Kiwisolver's documentation!
======================================

Kiwisolver is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
solving algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the
seminal Cassowary paper. It is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver.
Kiwisolver has been designed from the ground up to be lightweight and fast.
Kiwisolver range from 10x to 500x faster than the original Cassowary solver
with typical use cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings are
consistently > 5x.

In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships with hand-rolled Python bindings.
